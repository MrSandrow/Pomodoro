# [Pomodoro App](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/pomodoro-app-KBFnycJ6G)

## Requirements

- Study Design Patterns
- Determine how I should group my files (depending on file extension or feature)
- Determine if I should write Tests before Code
- Create a Design Doc (Setup the whole logic : What each Function is going to do & How it is related to the rest of the program)
- Add JS to my App
- Add a Link to the App & Releases & Tags on Github

## Next Releases

- Add buttons to increase / decrease the timer duration (Settings)

## Workflow

- Commit as often as possible
- Squash and Push my commits when a feature is complete
- Test the app using a Deploy Preview (might automate this test)
- Merge dev branch on main
