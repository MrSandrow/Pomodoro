# [Pomodoro App](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/pomodoro-app-KBFnycJ6G)

## Requirements

- Create a Design Doc (Setup the whole logic : What each Function is going to do & How it is related to the rest of the program)
- Determine how I should group my files (Depending on file extension or feature)
- Write my tests
- Add JS to my App
- Add a Link to the App & Releases & Tags on Github

## Next Releases

- Refactor my CSS to make it easily scalable (Create small components that can be put together)
- Reduce the height of the page to avoid scrolling on mobile devices
- Add buttons to increase / decrease the timer duration (Settings)
- Save the settings and the timer state in local storage
- Add features from [Pomofocus](https://pomofocus.io/) (My app should feature several pages)
- Add transitions between pages with Barba.js

## Workflow

- Commit as often as possible
- Squash and Push my commits when a feature is complete
- Review the app using a Branch Deploy
- Merge dev branch on main
