# [Pomodoro App](https://tymer.netlify.app/)

## Requirements

- Add a Link to the App & Releases & Tags on Github

## Next Releases

- Improve the layout for small devices in landscape mode (fix timer__time font size)
- Refactor my CSS to make it easily scalable (Create small components that can be put together, store them in a separate folder)
- Reduce the height of the page to avoid scrolling on mobile devices
- Add buttons to increase / decrease the timer duration (Settings)
- Save the settings and the timer state in local storage
- Add features from [Pomofocus](https://pomofocus.io/) (My app should feature several pages)

## Workflow

- Commit as often as possible
- Squash and Push my commits when a feature is complete
- Review the app using a Branch Deploy
- Merge dev branch on main
