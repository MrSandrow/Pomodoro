## Event Listeners

- Switch timers using the menu
- Start / Pause the timer when clicking on it

- Open the settings when clicking on the settings button
- Get the timers durations when applying the settings
- Set Font & Color when clicking on the appropriate buttons
- Apply / Close a modal when clicking on the appropriate buttons

## Business Logic

- Create a countdown

## State

- Currently selected timer
- Is the current timer running ?
- Is the current timer finished ?

- Each timer's duration
- Font & Color used in the app

- Which timer does the user want to switch to ? (when the warning modal is displayed)
- How long until the timer finishes ? (when the timer is paused)

## View

- Display the remaining time (every second until the timer is finished)
- Animate the progress bar (every second until the timer is finished)
- Display the timer state (start / pause / restart)

- Display a warning if the user tries to switch timers while a timer is running
- Disallow users to change the duration of a timer when it is running
